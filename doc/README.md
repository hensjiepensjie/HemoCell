# User documentation

The documentation of `HemoCell` is generated by
[`Doxygen`](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) and
[`Sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). The first generates the C/C++
code (developer) documentation, where the latter generates the hosted
documentation pages focussed on installations, examples, usage, etc.

The configuration for `Doxygen` is proved in `doc/doxygen/config.xml` and is
invoked as `doxygen config.xml` from the `doc/doxygen` directory. For `Sphinx`
the configuration is given in `dox/user_guide/conf.py` with all documentation
pages located in `doc/user_guide/` using the
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) (`*.rst`)
formatting.

## Building the docs

To build the docs ensure that `Doxygen` is available on the system and that
`Sphinx` and its requirements given in `doc/requirements.txt` are available in
the current Python environment. After activating your local virtual environment,
these can be installed as `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To clean and build the HTML documentation, evaluate the following command from
`doc/user_guide`:

```bash
make clean
make html
```

Note: `Sphinx` automatically invokes `Doxygen` to rebuild the
documentation pages of the code.
